🎟️ NFT-Based Event Ticketing System
by Team Soul Society

Welcome to our decentralized event ticketing solution powered by Solana Blockchain. Our platform merges Web2 and Web3 to provide a secure, verifiable, and transparent way to mint, buy, sell, and verify event tickets using NFTs.

🚀 Overview
We’ve built a full-stack NFT event ticketing ecosystem that includes:

🔐 User Authentication System
Built with HTML, CSS, and MongoDB, users can sign up and log in securely. Verified users are granted access to the ticket marketplace.

🎫 NFT Minting Engine (Rust on Solana)
Each event ticket is minted as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the Solana blockchain using native Rust programs, ensuring trust, ownership, and traceability.

💰 Price Capping Logic
We've implemented price cap constraints directly into the smart contract to protect users from price gouging and enforce fair resale prices.

📦 Buy & Sell Marketplace
Authenticated users are redirected to a seamless interface where they can buy or resell tickets, with all logic powered by Solana and Metaplex.

📱 QR Code Generator
After minting, each NFT ticket is tied to a unique QR code, allowing event staff to scan and verify ownership at the entrance.

✅ QR-Based Ticket Verification
Our verification system ensures each QR is linked directly to the NFT on-chain data, providing real-time validation and preventing counterfeits.
